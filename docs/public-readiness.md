# Public Readiness

This repository is intended for public use, but it must stay honest about its
scope.

## Positioning

- Community starter, not an official OpenAI product.
- Official-source-backed, with links to Codex documentation.
- Local setup kit, not a managed enterprise policy product.
- Safe defaults first; users intentionally enable account connectors.
- First-screen README includes English and Turkish entry points, real badges,
  and public-safe SVG visuals.

## Public User Requirements

- Clone-and-run instructions work from any directory.
- Windows PowerShell and Bash/WSL installers exist.
- Installers create backups before replacing managed files.
- Users can smoke-test with temporary `CODEX_HOME` and `AGENTS_HOME`.
- No real local state, auth, sessions, memories, project trust, or private paths
  are published.
- Authenticated MCPs are disabled until a user intentionally enables them.
- The package is marked `private: true` to avoid accidental npm publishing.
- README visuals are stored under `assets/`, include accessible SVG metadata,
  and do not use private screenshots, fake metrics, or unlicensed media.
- GitHub issue and pull request templates include public-safe reminders and
  bilingual context where useful.
- Dependabot is configured for GitHub Actions and npm manifest update PRs.

## Maintainer Requirements

Before pushing:

```bash
npm run check
git status --short
git diff --cached --check
gitleaks detect --redact --no-banner --no-git --verbose
```

After pushing:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
git -c http.sslBackend=openssl ls-remote origin refs/heads/main
```

The hashes must match.
